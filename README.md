# Fast Diet picker

This is a learning exercise for me to start using Python, and now Django for the site

What I plan to do is have a database of foods, which I have already compiled with the option to search the database from the webpage with another option to verify entries and add entries.

So after starting the fast diet I think a quick way to pick your food for fast days would be handy, Iâ€™m thinking a list of all food where you pick off what you want and it totals up the calories and can act as your shopping list as well
